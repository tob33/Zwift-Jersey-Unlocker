# Zwift-Jersey-Unlocker
Simple script to unlock 54 additional Zwift jerseys.

## How to use
- make sure you have installed 'keyboard' via pip
- launch Zwift and start a ride
- run the script
- - the script gives you five (5) seconds to navigate back to the Zwift window
- - the Zwift window will need to be the active window while the script runs

Project uses the codes on https://zwiftinsider.com/kits/

If you run into issues please don't hesitate to reach out (tis my first public repository)

Note: After running it once myself, I've noticed only a handful of the codes actually work, in the coming days I'll work on figuring out which codes do not work and take them out of the list of codes.
